Project Files
This folder contains two distinct files: a Python script for network analysis and a presentation on phishing awareness. Below is a quick guide to what each file is for and how to use it.

1. network_sniffer.py
What it is
This is a simple Python script that acts as a basic network packet sniffer. It uses the scapy library to capture network traffic on your machine and then prints out information about each packet, including the source and destination IP addresses and the protocol used (TCP, UDP, etc.).

How to use it
Before you run this script, you'll need to have scapy installed. You can do that using pip:

pip install scapy

Once scapy is installed, you can run the script from your terminal:

python network_sniffer.py

The script will immediately begin capturing packets. To stop it, just press Ctrl+C.

Note: This script requires administrator or root privileges to run on most systems, as it needs to access low-level network traffic.

2. Phishing-Awareness.pptx
What it is
This is a PowerPoint presentation designed for a Phishing Awareness Training session. It's targeted at undergraduate and graduate students and covers key aspects of cyber deception, including:

Why phishing is a significant threat.

How to spot red flags in suspicious emails and fake websites.

The social engineering tactics that attackers use.

Best practices for protecting yourself, like using multi-factor authentication (MFA).

How to use it
Simply open the file in a presentation program like Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides. It's ready to be used for an educational session or for self-study to help improve cybersecurity awareness.
